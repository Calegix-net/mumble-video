	/**
	 * Encrypts and authenticates video datagrams on a sequence space of their own.
	 *
	 * Why this exists rather than reusing CryptStateOCB2 directly: that class derives its nonce from a
	 * one-byte rolling counter and accepts a late packet only if it is within 30 of the newest one. That
	 * is a reasonable fit for audio at fifty packets a second. Video is bursty and two orders of
	 * magnitude faster, and - measured against the real implementation - a burst of 31 packets delivered
	 * in reverse already starts failing to decrypt, while a burst of 64 loses over half. Sharing the
	 * counter with audio made it worse still: the tolerance is counted in packets, so adding video to
	 * the same sequence shrank audio's jitter tolerance from roughly 600 ms to under 100 ms.
	 *
	 * So video carries an explicit 32-bit sequence number in the clear and derives its nonce from it,
	 * and replay protection is a sliding window rather than a single counter. The AES-OCB primitive
	 * underneath is unchanged - this is the same ocb_encrypt/ocb_decrypt the audio path uses, driven
	 * with a different nonce discipline.
	 *
	 * Not thread safe: one instance per direction per peer, touched by one thread.
	 *
	 * Note for review: the construction here is conventional - explicit sequence, sequence-derived
	 * nonce, sliding replay window - but it is new cryptographic plumbing and should be reviewed as
	 * such before it carries anyone's camera.
